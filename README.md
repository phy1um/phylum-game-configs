# Phylum's Game Configs

A collection of files and images storing important settings for my games - mostly Quake-family. These are only the most up-to-date versions of my configs (mostly), however I have many other settings that I have used over the years.

## Acceleration
Currently using: Intercept Mouse Accel (settings in accel_driver.png)

## Game Specific Notes

### Quake Live and CPMA
These .cfg files are modular. Distinct sections are in their own files. This makes it easy to have different versions of, for example, key bindings which can be swapped out easily. This means I can change use bound keys to change between different settings very quickly and easily.

### Reflex
These configs are OLD - designed for a very different version of the game. Do not use these. The UI code is a MESS and settings may be outdated! Crucially this contains my custom hud.

That said I still use this because everything is still just how I like it, except maybe the mouse sensitivity.

### QuakeWorld
Designed for use with ezQuake 3.X. Based on dirtbox's wonderful config which making in-depth QW setup sane.

### Quake 2
Just a dump of q2config.cfg from Q2Pro. Not a good example of a useable file but can be readily applied in a hurry, some decent customization here.
