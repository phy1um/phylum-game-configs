This is an informal "license" for items relating to software which I am simply a user of. (As such, it is unclear to me what belongs here.) These files are user configuration data, no copyrighted material has been shared in this repository.

As these are configuration files for games which I do not own, these files are free to be used and modified for use within the terms and conditions of the game to which they are associated. I ask that in derivetive works you credit me (phylum), and link this repository.
